### Links

- Live Site URL: [(https://flyo-data-storage-project.vercel.app/)]

## My process
Starting off was a little difficult just framing everything through html and utilizing divs properly. Also getting used to mobile first building was also something that was difficult. Really challenge was setting it up but after everything was set up thats when I started to gain some momemntum. Also getting the background through a media query was little challenging but I just did a lesson through FCC that did something similar so I at least know where to look at and the direction. Understanding the proper widths and initially the centering but eventually got past it. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learned better organization for div elements and utilizing classes for styling. Getting better utilizing flex box as well. Learned more about setting up the overall structure and then getting the styling. Learned more mobile first responsive techniques and slowly getting at doing that. Utilizing gap for the icons was also something that Im getting better at and not just being laser focused on using margin. Gap really helped as I was having trouble with margin and the spacing wasn't consistent and gap helped me with that. Background and background color learning the difference. Making the icon boxes the same size so no overflow would hapepns since the images were both different sizes. Also learned how to have half of a background image like the preview. Using media queries was also something that Im starting to understand. 




### Continued development

Need to just keep practcicing. Praciticing structuring properly because thats the overall foundation and if thats not right everything else is going to be difficult than what it really is. Understanding a lot everything starting to click and also practicing media queries and mobile first projects is something that im looking at building more of. 

*Edit*
For the flyo storage card and the top container don't a set height but do padding so the text doesn't overflow. Grow the height with line height. Need to look at that and just fine tune responsivness. Doing better. Don't set a set width either.
