### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process
Starting off was a little difficult just framing everything through html and utilizing divs properly. Also getting used to mobile first building was also something that was difficult. Really challenge was setting it up but after everything was set up thats when I started to gain some momemntum. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Learned better organization for div elements and utilizing classes for styling. Getting better utilizing flex box as well. Learned more about setting up the overall structure and then getting the styling. Learned more mobile first responsive techniques and slowly getting at doing that. Utilizing gap for the icons was also something that Im getting better at and not just being laser focused on using margin. Gap really helped as I was having trouble with margin and the spacing wasn't consistent and gap helped me with that. Background and background color learning the difference. Making the icon boxes the same size so no overflow would hapepns since the images were both different sizes. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
